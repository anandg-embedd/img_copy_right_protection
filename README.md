# Simple_Image_Encryption_DMA
This is a simple image encryption algorithm based on DMA (Diffused Mandelbrot set + Arnold map) system.

This is a simple image encryption code for beginers to practice the matlab code. The code exploits the properties of mandelbrot set and arnold map and,it provides cipher image with maximum security.
