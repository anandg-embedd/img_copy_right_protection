# Simple_Image_Encryption_DMA
This is a simple image encryption algorithm based on DMA (Diffused Mandelbrot set + Arnold map) system.

This is a simple image encryption code for beginers to practice the matlab code. The code exploits the properties of mandelbrot set and arnold map and,it provides cipher image with maximum security.

Note: If you are using our code for your system or project, you should always cite our paper as a reference.K C.Jithin, SyamSankar, "Colour image encryption algorithm combining Arnold map, DNA sequence operation, and a Mandelbrot set",Journal of Information Security and Applications, Elsevier, Volume 50, February 2020,DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2019.102428
